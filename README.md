# Training App

This project is a web application designed to facilitate sign-ups for training sessions. Users can provide necessary information such as their name, surname, email address, and photo, and select a training day and time. The application also fetches holiday data from the Ninja API to exclude Sundays and public holidays as training days, marking them as unavailable for selection and providing information about the holidays next to their names.
